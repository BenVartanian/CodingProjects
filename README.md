# CodingProjects
A collection of various coding projects I've done in my free time.
1. LFSREncryption.py is a Linear-feedback shift register encryption/decryption program I created. Simply put any text you'd like into data and see what it looks like encrypted.
2. Login.py is a bit of a larger project but was my attempt at making a super basic web server with login capabilities. The webpage is paired to a backend MySQL database and any input is salted and hashed before being stored on the backend.
